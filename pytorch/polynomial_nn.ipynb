        "\nPyTorch: nn\n-----------\n\nA third order polynomial, trained to predict $y=\\sin(x)$ from $-\\pi$\nto $pi$ by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.\n\nThis implementation uses the nn package from PyTorch to build the network.\nPyTorch autograd makes it easy to define computational graphs and take gradients,\nbut raw autograd can be a bit too low-level for defining complex neural networks;\nthis is where the nn package can help. The nn package defines a set of Modules,\nwhich you can think of as a neural network layer that produces output from\ninput and may have some trainable weights.\n"
